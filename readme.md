# Advent of Code 2024
These are my solutions to the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) puzzle. This is some fun for me after I've exhausted the NYT Games for the day and I'm looking for more puzzles to solve. It also shows my general approach to programming problems especially those involving data structures. If you have feedback, feel free to open an issue.
